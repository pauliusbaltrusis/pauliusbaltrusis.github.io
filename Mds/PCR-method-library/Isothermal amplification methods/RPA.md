# RPA

Owner: Paulius Baltrušis

**RPA** is a DNA amplification technique designed for rapid, sensitive, and specific nucleic acid detection under **isothermal conditions** (similar to LAMP), avoiding the need for thermal cycling. Initially invented by [Piepenburg et al., 2006]([https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040204](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040204)), its distinguishing features are:

**Principle of Amplification**:

- RPA uses a **recombinase-primer complex** to facilitate homologous pairing of primers with complementary target DNA sequences.
- The recombinase binds primers and scans the target DNA for homologous sequences, enabling strand exchange and primer binding.

**Mechanism**:

- **Recombinase Proteins**: Form a filament with primers to guide them to their complementary sequences on the target DNA.
- **Single-Strand Binding (SSB) Proteins**: Stabilize the displaced single strand during primer binding.
- **DNA Polymerase**: Extends the primers and displaces the downstream strand, enabling continuous amplification at a constant temperature (37–42°C).

**Products**:

- RPA generates amplified DNA fragments in a sequence-specific manner. Amplification is exponential and can be detected in real-time or endpoint assays using fluorescent probes, lateral flow strips, or gel electrophoresis (refer to the original paper).

**Advantages**:

- **Speed**: Amplification occurs rapidly, typically within 20–40 minutes.
- **Low Temperature**: Operates at a constant temperature close to physiological conditions (37–42°C).
- **High Sensitivity**: Detects low amounts of DNA, often in the range of femtograms.
- **Versatility**: Works well with crude samples and minimal preprocessing.
- **Field Deployable**: Requires minimal equipment, making it suitable for point-of-care or field-based applications.

**Applications**:

Initially developed for DNA detection, RPA has since been applied to various fields, including infectious disease diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and food safety testing.
