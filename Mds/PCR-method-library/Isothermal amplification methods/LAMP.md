# LAMP

**LAMP** is a DNA amplification technique designed for rapid and specific amplification of nucleic acids under isothermal conditions, eliminating the need for thermal cycling. Originally invented by [Notomi et al., 2000](<https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/28/12/e63/2359194>), this method relies on the following key features:

**Principle of Amplification**:

- LAMP uses 4-6 primers specifically designed to recognize 6-8 distinct regions of the target DNA, ensuring high specificity.
- A strand-displacing DNA polymerase drives the amplification, enabling continuous synthesis without requiring denaturation by heat.

**Mechanism**:

- The primers form loop structures in the amplified product, which serve as templates for subsequent rounds of amplification.
- This process results in a cascade of amplification, producing large amounts of DNA in a short time.
- New England Biolabs (NEB) has some really good material explaining how LAMP works. You can refer to their [webpage material](<https://www.neb.com/en/applications/dna-amplification-pcr-and-qpcr/isothermal-amplification/loop-mediated-isothermal-amplification-lamp>) or [YouTube video](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5zi2P4lggw&ab_channel=NewEnglandBiolabs>).

**Products**:

- The amplified DNA forms a series of concatemers with a characteristic "dumbbell" or loop structure, which further amplify themselves.
- The reaction generates a high concentration of DNA, which can be detected visually (e.g., turbidity, fluorescence) or through electrophoresis.

**Advantages**:

- Speed: Amplification is typically complete within 30-60 minutes.
- Isothermal: Requires only a constant temperature (usually 60–65°C), simplifying equipment needs.
- High Specificity: Due to the use of multiple primers targeting distinct regions.
- Robustness: LAMP tolerates inhibitors better than PCR, making it suitable for complex biological samples.

Initially demonstrated for gene-specific amplification, the original LAMP has since undergone many different modifications and has been widely adopted for diagnostics, particularly in infectious disease detection, point-of-care testing, and resource-limited settings.
