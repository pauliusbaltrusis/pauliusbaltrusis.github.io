# Hyperplex PCR

A somewhat similar (in my opinion) to the superRCA method is called hyperplex (hp)PCR. Due to copyright reasons, I canâ€™t describe the method here. Instead, find more information about hpPCR here - [Soares et al., 2024](<https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.06.10.24308715v1.full-text>).
