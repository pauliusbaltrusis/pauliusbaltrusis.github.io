# qPCR

Owner: Paulius Baltru≈°is

qPCR has been around for some 30 years and is a staple method used in every molecular biology lab around the world. With that in mind, in this chapter I will skip SYBR/EvaGreen and TaqMan probe based applications and review only the more rarely talked about, probe-type constructs for nucleic acid detection and quantification.

Start with:

[Molecular Beacons]()

[Scorpion Probes]()
