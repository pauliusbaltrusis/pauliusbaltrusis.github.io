# Ultra-Rapid ddPCR

The pre-print by [ZR Murphy et al., 2024](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11160868/#F4) (can also be found as a limited access publication [here](https://www.cell.com/med/abstract/S2666-6340(25)00031-5?rss=yes)) introduces an accelerated droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) method, termed Ultra-Rapid ddPCR (**UR-ddPCR**), designed for swift genetic analysis during surgical procedures. This technique facilitates the detection of specific tumor mutations within approximately 15 minutes, thereby aiding real-time surgical decision-making.

Key Methodological Enhancements:

- **Expedited DNA Extraction:** The study employs a rapid DNA extraction protocol compatible with subsequent ddPCR analysis, significantly reducing preparation time.
- **Optimized Thermal Cycling:** Utilizing preheated water baths and thin stainless steel capillaries, the method achieves ultra-fast thermal cycling, enhancing heat transfer efficiency compared to conventional plastic plates.
- **Increased Reagent Concentrations:** Adjustments include elevating the concentrations of primers, probes, and Aptamer Hot-Start Taq polymerase, alongside increasing the number of PCR cycles, which collectively enable a reduction in the annealing/extension step to 1 second, culminating in a total PCR duration of 3 minutes.

Performance and Accuracy:

- **Mutation Detection Sensitivity:** UR-ddPCR demonstrated the capability to detect IDH1 R132H and BRAF V600E mutations at a 0.1% frequency, with false positive rates of 0.05% and 0.04%, respectively, aligning closely with standard ddPCR protocols.
- **Droplet Amplification Efficiency:** The UR-ddPCR protocol was shown to yield fewer (15%) positive droplets, compared to standard protocols (29%). Since this was observed for both wild-type and mutant templates, the proportionality rescues the accuracy (down to 0.1%) of the method.

**Clinical Application:**

The study validated UR-ddPCR by analyzing 49 samples across 13 surgical cases. The results were consistent with those obtained from standard ddPCR, underscoring UR-ddPCR's reliability. The rapid turnaround of this technique holds potential to guide surgical decisions in real-time, optimizing tumor resection strategies.
