# Wastewater Monitoring


An interesting preprint by [Balogh et al., 2024](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.08.21.24311866v1) presents a comprehensive approach to wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance. Conducted over 32 months at a major metropolitan wastewater treatment plant, the study demonstrates the efficacy of combining a novel RNA extraction method with reverse transcription-droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR) and targeted mutation assays to monitor viral load and variant dynamics in the community.

This study combined the following approach(es) to assess the viral/variant dynamics in the community:

1. Two-Step Direct Capture RNA Extraction -> Integration with RT-ddPCR to monitor for absolute quantification of viral RNA
2. Targeted Mutation Assays to delineate between different SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in the population
3. Longitudinal Surveillance period ensured a comprehensive view of viral load fluctuations and variant dynamics

This study highlights the potential of RT-ddPCR-based wastewater surveillance as a powerful tool for public health monitoring. Specifically, it can:

  - Monitor Infected Populations: By quantifying viral RNA in wastewater, health authorities can estimate infection levels in the community, including asymptomatic cases.

  - Delineate Circulating Serotypes: Targeted mutation assays enable the identification and tracking of SARS-CoV-2 variants, informing on the spread and dominance of specific strains.

  - Predict Outbreaks: Early detection of increases in viral load or the emergence of new variants can serve as a warning system, allowing for timely interventions.

  Another impressive study from an optimization and multiplexing perspective was performed and published by [Zafeiriadou et al., 2025](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.analchem.5c04372).

  In this paper, the authors developed a 9-plex Multiplex One-Step RT-ddPCR assay to detect 9 targets in a single well (6 viral targets - SARS-CoV2 N1&N2, Influenza A M gene, Influenza B NS gene, RSV M gene, Hep A 5UTR, Hep E ORF3; 3 controls - B2M endogenous, IC endogenous & EC).

  The most surprising finding was how little optimization needed to be done (adjusting annealing temp, extension time & concentrations of the primes & probes).

  The LOD value was set at 2.2 (95% CI: 1.7−2.7), 2.0 (95% CI: 1.6−2.4), 1.4 (95% CI: 1.1−1.7), 2.1 (95% CI: 1.7−2.4), 2.9 (95% CI: 2.4−3.3), 1.8 (95% CI: 1.4−2.2) and 1.9 (95% CI: 1.6−2.2) copies/μL of sample input for SARS-CoV-2 N1 gene, N2 gene, IAV, IBV, RSV, HAV, and HEV, respectively.

  LOQ was set as the lowest detected concentration that had a coefficient of variation (CV) ≤ 25 and was set at 5.8, 6.1, 3.46, 5.45, 5.89, 6.14, and 4.61 copies/μL for SARS-CoV-2 N1 gene, N2 gene, IAV, IBV, RSV, HAV, and HEV, respectively.
