# Optimization

Owner: Paulius Baltrušis

In this Optimization chapter you’ll find information on the general “good advice” when running ddPCR experiments, whether in singleplex or multiplex, optimization of both singleplex and multiplex reactions, as well as a few ideas on when it makes sense to incorporate LNAs, Degenerate bases and dark probes into your assays. Finally, you’ll find some practical information on determining the Limit of Blank, Limit of Detection and Limit of Quantification, which are important assay-specific properties that can help you make an informed decision on the status of your actual sample(s) (e.g. robustly separating positive(s) from negative(s)).
