# Most Common Sample Types in ddPCR

Digital droplet PCR can be run with a variety of sample types, making it versatile for numerous applications in research and diagnostics. Some of the most common sample types compatible with ddPCR are listed below:

**DNA Samples**

- **Genomic DNA**: Extracted from a variety of organisms, such as humans, animals, plants, and microbes.
- **Cell-free DNA (cfDNA)**: Found in plasma, used in liquid biopsies for cancer detection and prenatal screening.
- **Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)**: Derived from tumors and released into the bloodstream, used for cancer diagnostics and monitoring.
- **Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue DNA**: Used in cancer research and diagnostics, as well as for archival tissue studies.

**RNA Samples**

- **Total RNA**: Extracted from cells or tissues and reverse transcribed into cDNA for quantification of gene expression.
- **Cell-free RNA**: Found in plasma or other bodily fluids, used in non-invasive diagnostics.
- **Viral RNA**: Used in the detection and quantification of viral infections (e.g., HIV, SARS-CoV-2) after reverse transcription to cDNA.

**Tissue Samples**

- **Fresh or frozen tissues**: Used in research for gene expression or mutation analysis.
- **Biopsies**: Small tissue samples, including fine needle aspirations, for disease research or diagnostics.

**Bodily Fluids**

- **Blood/Plasma/Serum**: Commonly used for liquid biopsy applications, monitoring disease biomarkers, and quantifying circulating nucleic acids.
- **Urine**: Contains cfDNA and other biomarkers, useful in non-invasive diagnostics.
- **Saliva**: Can be used for detecting viral or bacterial DNA, as well as human DNA for genetic testing.
- **Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)**: Useful in detecting the presence of some pathogens such as *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*.

**Microbial and Viral Samples**

- **Bacterial and viral DNA/RNA**: ddPCR is used for quantifying microbial loads in environmental samples, infections, or microbiome studies.

**Environmental Samples**

- **Soil and water samples**: Can be used to detect and quantify microbial or viral DNA present in the environment.
