# RNA and Protein-based ddPCR Methods

In this chapter you will find methods aimed at detecting and quantifying RNA and/or Protein molecules. Topics such as integrity of long RNA molecules, average RNA copies per target gene, single cell RNA & protein quantification, miRNA quantification, single cell mutant RNA enrichment, extracellular vesicle detection and single cell transcript profiling and radial multiplexing are covered.
