# About This Website
The goal of this website is (at least) two-fold:

  - To gather and pre-process information on various qPCR and ddPCR methods. The aim is to build an easily accessible and comprehensive library focused solely on explaining different quantitative and digital PCR techniques, along with references to the original studies that utilized them.

  - To serve as a go-to resource for anyone interested in designing custom qPCR or ddPCR experiments. The vision is to turn this *in silico* library into a starting point for students, technicians, and scientists to generate new ideas, or apply existing, well-documented approaches to answer specific research questions within their field.
