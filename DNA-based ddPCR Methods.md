# DNA-based ddPCR Methods

This chapter covers a few different ddPCR methods related to the detection of multiple variants with drop-off probes, gene edits, pathogens, linkage, performing long amplicon ddPCR, methylation analysis  using MSREs, utilizing BDA as an approach to enrich for mutant templates in your mixed samples, running amplitude multiplexing for multiple mutation detection in addition to simplified multiplex mutation detection strategies, performing viral integration copy number estimations and detecting structural variants.
