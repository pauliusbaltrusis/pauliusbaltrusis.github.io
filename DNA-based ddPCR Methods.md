# DNA-based ddPCR methods

This chapter covers a few different ddPCR methods, related to pathogen detection, linkage, viral integration copy number estimations, methylation analysis using MSREs, detecting structural variants, detecting multiple variants with drop-off probes, multiplex mutation detection, amplitude multiplexing, long amplicon ddPCR and utilizing BDA as an approach to enrich for mutant templates in your mixed samples.
