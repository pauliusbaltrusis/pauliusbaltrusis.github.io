# Isothermal amplification methods

The newest generation of isothermal, amplification-based nucleic acid detection and quantification methods are primarily based on the rolling circle amplification technology, which has been around at least since the late 1990s (check [Lizardi et al., 1998]([https://www.nature.com/articles/ng0798_225)). As it turns out, generating circular molecules and amplifying those with a strand displacing polymerase creates huge concatemers (with many copies of the target loci for subsequent detection with eg., molecular beacons) that can be analyzed with a eg., fluorescence microscope and even counted, without having to rely on statistical approximations. Here I will describe some new, some old, isothermal amplification methods.
